# CSE-435-HFDS
Michigan State Software Engineering Group 3 Hands-Free Driving System

## Background
For this project, we are partnering with [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/) to design a hands-free driving system.

## [Project Description](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse435/Projects/F2019/ProjectDescriptions/2019-HFDS-GM-Davenport.pdf)
_The objective of this project is to develop a system that is capable of hands-free highway driving. The
system will allow drivers to enable a hands-free assisted driving feature which will drive the vehicle in its
existing lane without needing to control the steering wheel._

## Deployment
This site is hosted on Heroku and goes through a CI/CD pipeline with every change on the master branch. You can check the site out [here](https://cse435-hfds.herokuapp.com/) for the hosted version or peruse the source code here.

I opted to use Heroku to make it easier to add server-side code if it ever becomes necessary for the prototype portion of this project.
